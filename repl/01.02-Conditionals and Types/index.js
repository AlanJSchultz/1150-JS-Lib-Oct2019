//jshint esversion:7

/*
Write a conditional that will check the value of one property in an object and console.log a message
based upon the type of the property.

For instance,
if sampleObject.sampleKey is a string, it will console.log 'the value is a string'.If
sampleObject.sampleKey is a number, it will console.log 'the value is a number'.
Make sure your conditional works for strings, numbers, booleans, and objects.

If you have successfully solved this challenge with an if-else if statement,
try it with a ternary.
