/*

04.03 - Promise, .then, .catch

Write a custom - built promise.

If Date.now() has an even number of milliseconds, 
the promise should resolve.

If Date.now() has an odd number of milliseconds, 
the promise should reject.

In either case, use .then & .catch to handle the 
resolved or rejected promise and print a message.
