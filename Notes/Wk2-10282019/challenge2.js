Challenge 2:

Let 's compose functions!  

Your first function should take a function as input and 
return that function with a function call.

Your second function should take a string as input and
return that string with extra stuff added to that string.

Console.log the results of your function calls.

Additional information is below to help clarify what you're doing 
(the below is just an example):

first function: input - secondFunc output - secondFunc('coding is great!')

second function: input - 'coding is great!'
output - 'coding is great!  pie is, too!'
